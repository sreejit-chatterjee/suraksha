## Feature Documentation

### Core Safety Features

#### 1. Safety Status Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
The Safety Status dashboard provides users with real-time information about their current safety situation, combining both objective data analysis and emergency response capabilities in one centralized interface.

**Components:**
- **Safety Score**: A dynamic rating system that evaluates the safety of the user's current location
- **SOS Button**: An emergency trigger mechanism for immediate assistance

**Technical Implementation:**
- Rendered as a prominent card in the home screen UI
- Uses motion animations for smooth transitions and visual emphasis
- Implements a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes

\`\`\`tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: 0.1 }}
  className="glass-card p-6"
>
  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary-foreground">Your Safety Status</h2>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
    <SafetyScore score={safetyScore} />
    <SosButton onActivate={handleSosActivation} />
  </div>
</motion.div>
\`\`\`

#### 2. Safety Score

**Purpose:**  
Provides users with a quantitative assessment of their current location's safety level based on multiple data points.

**How It Works:**
- Calculates a safety score on a scale of 1-10
- Factors in time of day, crime statistics, crowdedness, lighting conditions, and proximity to safe zones
- Visually represents the score with color-coding and descriptive text

**Technical Details:**
- Uses the `calculateSafetyScore()` function from the safety-score.ts library
- Implements a circular progress indicator that fills proportionally to the score
- Color-coded feedback: green (safe), yellow (moderate), red (caution)

**User Benefits:**
- Instant awareness of environmental safety conditions
- Ability to make informed decisions about routes and locations
- Visual feedback that's easy to understand at a glance

#### 3. SOS Button

**Purpose:**  
Provides an emergency response mechanism that can be activated quickly in threatening situations.

**How It Works:**
- Press and hold for 3 seconds to activate emergency response
- Sends alerts to emergency contacts with the user's current location
- Provides visual and haptic feedback during activation countdown

**Technical Details:**
- Implements a press-and-hold interaction pattern with countdown timer
- Uses geolocation API to capture precise location coordinates
- Sends emergency notifications through multiple channels (SMS, email, app notifications)
- Includes fallback to approximate location when precise geolocation is unavailable

**User Benefits:**
- One-touch emergency response in dangerous situations
- Countdown mechanism prevents accidental activation
- Automatic location sharing with emergency contacts
- Works even in areas with limited connectivity

#### 4. Location Tracking & Mapping

**Purpose:**  
Displays the user's current location on an interactive map with safety overlay data.

**How It Works:**
- Shows the user's real-time location on a map interface
- Displays safety heat map with color-coded areas
- Allows users to view and add safety ratings for specific locations

**Technical Details:**
- Uses device geolocation API with fallback to default coordinates
- Implements a custom canvas-based map rendering system
- Supports interactive features like zooming, panning, and location marking

**User Benefits:**
- Visual awareness of current location and surrounding safety conditions
- Ability to plan routes through safer areas
- Community-contributed safety information

#### 5. Guardian Mode

**Purpose:**  
Allows trusted contacts to monitor the user's location during potentially unsafe situations.

**How It Works:**
- Toggle to enable/disable location sharing with designated guardians
- Guardians receive real-time location updates when mode is active
- Option to share specific routes with guardians

**Technical Details:**
- Implements secure location sharing with end-to-end encryption
- Uses background location services for continuous updates
- Includes battery optimization to minimize power consumption

**User Benefits:**
- Peace of mind through passive monitoring by trusted contacts
- No need to actively check in when in potentially unsafe situations
- Privacy controls to enable/disable as needed

#### 6. Safety Check-In

**Purpose:**  
Establishes a regular check-in system to verify user safety at set intervals.

**How It Works:**
- User sets a check-in interval (e.g., every 15 minutes)
- App prompts user to confirm safety at each interval
- Alerts emergency contacts if user fails to check in

**Technical Details:**
- Implements customizable timer system with user-defined intervals
- Uses local notifications for check-in reminders
- Includes location capture with each check-in

**User Benefits:**
- Automated safety verification system
- Alerts sent automatically if user becomes unresponsive
- Customizable to match different activity types and risk levels

### Future Enhancements

   - Audio analysis to detect distress in voice or environmental sounds
   - Abnormal movement pattern detection
   - Predictive risk assessment based on location, time, and historical data

2. **Community Safety Network**
   - Anonymous reporting of unsafe areas or incidents
   - Real-time alerts for nearby users when incidents are reported
   - Crowdsourced safety routes and recommendations

3. **Integration with Law Enforcement**
   - Direct emergency service connection
   - Automated incident reporting
   - Video/audio evidence capture and secure storage

4. **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**
   - Learning user's normal routes and schedules
   - Detecting deviations that might indicate safety concerns
   - Personalized safety recommendations based on user habits

5. **Offline Mode Capabilities**
   - Core safety features functional without internet connection
   - Local data storage with sync when connection restored
   - SMS-based emergency alerts when data connectivity is unavailable
